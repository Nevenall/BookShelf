# BookShelf

BookShelf is a template for a [material designed](https://m3.material.io/) [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) to present books constructed using [write](https://github.com/Nevenall/write).

This is a rewritten version using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). It replaces the previous version which used Vue and Webpack. 

Some reasons to check it out:

- Fast, light, and flexible
- Excellent mobile device support
- Offline first 

## Thanks!

A big thank you to [zuurw](https://github.com/zuurw/Graphic-Design-) for creating the BookShelf logo!
